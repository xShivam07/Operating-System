Linux 
Day 1 Assignment:

Problem No 1:

a) Navigate and List: 
	
Start by navigating to your home directory and list its contents. Then, move into a 
directory named "LinuxAssignment" if it exists; otherwise, create it.

Command : cd home     			//navigating to your home directory 
	  ls 	     			//list its contents
	  mkdir LinuxAssignment		//create directory named "LinuxAssignment"

b) File Management: 

 Inside the "LinuxAssignment" directory, create a new file named "file1.txt". Display its 
 contents. 

Command : cd LinuxAssignment       	//Inside the "LinuxAssignment" directory
	  cat > file1.txt		//create a new file named "file1.txt"
	  cat file1.txt			//Display its contents.

c) Directory Management: 

Create a new directory named "docs" inside the "LinuxAssignment" directory. 

Command : mkdir docs			//Create a new directory named "docs" 

d) Copy and Move Files: 

Copy the "file1.txt" file into the "docs" directory and rename it to "file2.txt".

Command : cp file1.txt docs/file2.txt	

e) Permissions and Ownership: 

Change the permissions of "file2.txt" to allow read, write, and execute permissions for 
the owner and only read permissions for others. Then, change the owner of "file2.txt" to 
the current user.

Command : chmod 744 file2.txt   	//Change the permissions of "file2.txt" to allow read, write, and execute
	  chown "$whoami" file2.txt 	//change the owner of "file2.txt" to the current user


f) Final Checklist: 

Finally, list the contents of the "LinuxAssignment" directory and the root directory to 
ensure that all operations were performed correctly.

Command : cd ..				//Come back to LinuxAssignment Directory
	  ls -l				//list the contents of the "LinuxAssignment" directory
	  cd /				//Come back to root diretory.
	  ls				//list the contents of the root directory.

g) File Searching: 

a. Search for all files with the extension ".txt" in the current directory and its subdirectories. 
b. Display lines containing a specific word in a file (provide a file name and the specific 
word to search).

Command : find . -type f -name "*.txt"   // Search for all files with the extension ".txt".
	  grep "Shivam" file1.txt   	// Display lines containing a specific word in a file.

h) System Information: 

 Display the current system date and time.

Command :  date				// Display the current system date and time

i) Networking: 

a. Display the IP address of the system. 
b. Ping a remote server to check connectivity (provide a remote server address to ping).


Command : ifconfig			//Display the IP address of the system.
	  ping -c 4 google.com		//Ping a remote server to check connectivity.

j) File Compression: 

a. Compress the "docs" directory into a zip file. 
b. Extract the contents of the zip file into a new directory. 

Command : cd LinuxDirectory		//Come into LinuxDirectory.
	  zip -r docs.zip docs		//Compress the "docs" directory into a zip file.
	  mkdir newdocs			// make new directory
	  unzip docs.zip -d newdocs	//Extract the contents of the zip file into a new directory

k) File Editing: 

a. Open the "file1.txt" file in a text editor and add some text to it. 
b. Replace a specific word in the "file1.txt" file with another word (provide the original 
word and the word to replace it with).

Command : cat >> file1.txt		 //Open the "file1.txt" file in a text editor and add some text to it.
